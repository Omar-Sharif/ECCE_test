Suspicious Bangla text detection is a text classification problem of classifying Bangla text into suspicious and non suspicious category. In this paper we tried to find out the  performance of different statistical machine learning algorithm for detecting suspicious Bangla text. To the best of our knowledge, it is very first work on detecting suspicious Bangla text so we have to develop a corpus of suspicious Bangla text. This paper shows comparison of accuracy of different machine learning algorithm which will be helpful to others. The experimental result shows maximum accuracy of 92\% for Logistic Regression using 1500 training documents and 500 testing documents. The overall accuracy can be increased by increasing number of text documents in the dataset and considering semantic relation between words of a sentence.
