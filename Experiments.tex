\section{\textbf{Experiments}}
For the successful implementation of any machine learning algorithm dataset is the key. It was a very challenging task for us to build a corpus which contains a large amount of suspicious and non suspicious text. We have collected non suspicious data from a pre-build corpus\cite{banglacorpus}, thanks to them. Suspicious data are collected from different online and offline resources.% Data stored in .txt format.

We mark a text as suspicious if it has one of the following features,
\begin{itemize}
    \item Texts contain words which hurts our religious feelings.\vspace{0.2cm} 
    \item Texts which instigate people against government.\vspace{0.2cm} 
    \item Texts which instigate people against law enforcement agencies.\vspace{0.2cm} 
    \item Texts which motivate people in terrorist events.\vspace{0.2cm} 
    \item Texts which instigate a community without any reason.\vspace{0.2cm} 
    \item Texts which instigate our political parties. 
\end{itemize}
 \par \vspace{0.3cm}
 Most of our suspicious data about religion are collected from online blogs\cite{nastikya, dhormo, istishon}. Suspicious data about politics is collected from websites of different newspaper\cite{palo, kk, juga}. Data is also collected from different public pages of Facebook\cite{bash}. Table \ref{data} represents the statistics of data used for our model.

In order to classify the texts, we have fed our collected documents to our classifier model. As dataset is collected manually it may have some inconsistency.
